    ----------
    cpu_all_hosts : int
        This is a class attribute, hence common for all objects of this class, i.e. common 
        value for all substrate hosts representing how much total CPU they have alogether 
        combined. 
        Starting with some percentage of CPU reserved (here 1000), then will keep adding 
        the cpu_limits of all substrate hosts to this variable. Reason for doing this is 
        so that at all times, 100% of CPU is not totally given to all mininet hosts combined 
        as that leads to values less that expected on running runCpuLimitTest().
